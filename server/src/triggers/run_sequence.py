"""Build a chronological per-run edit-distance sequence from a student's events.
Vendored from lm-dashboard/app/runs/run_sequence.py (import path only: .apted_similarity
is now .distance).

Only runProject events take part; each run after the first gets the integer APTED
edit_distance against the previous run. The first run has no predecessor (None).

Public API:
    compute_run_edit_distances(events) -> {
        "runs": [{"index": int, "edit_distance": int|None, "ts": float|None,
                  "playground": str|None}, ...]
    }

`events` is a chronological list of dicts, each carrying at least
    {"event_type": "...", "content": {...parsed VEX log content...}, "ts": float|None}

NOTE: wiring this to the agent's EventRecord stream is a separate slice (issue #4).
This module stays on the dashboard's dict shape so it's a faithful vendor.
