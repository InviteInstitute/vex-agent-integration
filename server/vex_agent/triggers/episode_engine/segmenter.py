"""
Batch episode segmentation: carving a session into CODE / RUN / RESET episodes.

Vendored from lm-dashboard/app/episode_engine/segmenter.py (which mirrors the
segmentation logic in Caitlin's learner-model-pipeline/src/episodes.py).

It walks a time-sorted event sequence and groups it into episodes, stopping at
hard-pause boundaries and pulling "soft" UI events into whatever episode
surrounds them.

segment_episodes inputs:
- events: dicts with at least {'event_type', 'ts'}, sorted by ts.
- hard_pause_after_idx: a set of indices i where a hard pause sits between
  events[i] and events[i+1]. Computed by the pause detectors below from gaps
  >= PAUSE_THRESHOLD_S (INACTIVE_PAUSE) or from POST_RUN_PAUSE.

segment_episodes output:
- a list of episode dicts: {episode_type, boundary, start_idx, end_idx,
  start_ts, end_ts, event_count, soft_indices}, where start_idx is inclusive and
  end_idx is exclusive (Caitlin's repo convention).
